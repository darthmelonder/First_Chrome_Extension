# First_Chrome_Extension
My First Chrome Extension<br />
This is one of the first chrome extensions I ever built.<br />
The only thing this extension it does is that it changes the writers<br />
of every contest present in https://www.codeforces.com/contests . <br />
To install this chrome extension ,<br />
 download/clone the project directory: "First_Chrome_Extension-master".<br />
go to chrome -> type: "chrome://extensions" in url <br />
-> enable "Developer Mode" <br />
-> Load unpacked <br />
-> select the project directory where you downloaded it.<br />
Refresh or Go to the page: https://www.codeforces.com/contests. <br />
It will change the writers of each contest to the name mentioned in script.js . <br />
