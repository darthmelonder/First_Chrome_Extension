# First_Chrome_Extension
My First Chrome Extension
This is one of the first chrome extensions I ever built. 
The only thing this extension it does is that it changes the writers
of every contest present in https://www.codeforces.com/contests . 
To install this chrome extension ,
 download/clone the project directory: "First_Chrome_Extension-master".
go to chrome -> type: "chrome://extensions" in url 
-> enable "Developer Mode"
-> Load unpacked
-> select the project directory where you downloaded it.
Refresh or Go to the page: https://www.codeforces.com/contests. 
It will change the writers of each contest to the name mentioned in script.js .
